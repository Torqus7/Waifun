    "Where does the character come from? Check if the Franchise you are trying to add the character to exists, when sending the character to moderation, where the franchise would show, there'll be a message telling you if the franchise you wrote was found, if there is one with a name similar to it, or if it'll be created. If you want to add it to the existing franchise then use the exact same name: `Naruto and Naruto Shippuden belong to the Naruto Franchise`, we don't create 2 versions of the same characters just because they look slightly different or are of a different age. In other example: `Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas could be different franchises, because they don't share characters and it's also worth considering that both have a massive amount of characters`.")

Example: `Image1,Image2,Image3`")
